# Astrovim user configurations

This repository contains my personal configurations using for Neovide based on [AstroNvim](www.github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim) configuration.

## Installation

1. Backup your current configuration

   ```bash
    mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.bak
    mv ~/.local/share/nvim ~/.local/share/nvim.bak
   ```

2. Clone Astrovim if you haven't already done so

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim ~/.config/nvim
    ```

3. Clone this repository to your home directory

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Lilanga/astrovim-user.git ~/.config/nvim/lua/user
    ```

## OS / Environment tested

Victor Mono NF and Hack Nerd Font are used in the configuration.

This configuration has been tested on Windows and some tweaks done for pwsh. This should work on other environments, but I haven't tested it. I have different user configurations for my macos setup.

Currently using with Neovim 0.10.0

## Screenshots

Following are screenshots of the applied NVIM configuration. I am using Iterm2 with semi transparent background settings. The font used is Fira Code.
